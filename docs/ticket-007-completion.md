# ✅ Ticket #7 Completion Report: `/predict` Endpoint with Model Integration

### 📝 Ticket Summary
**Title**: [Endpoint] Implement /predict Endpoint (Single Model Support)  
**Milestone**: Phase 1 – Model Integration  
**Estimate**: 3 hours  

Expose a `/predict` endpoint that accepts a ticker and model, pulls real-time stock data, performs preprocessing, and returns future price predictions using a specified model (initially XGBoost).

---

### ✅ Final Deliverables

| Item | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| `/predict` POST endpoint | ✅ | Accepts `ticker` and `horizon_hours` as JSON input |
| Model inference (XGBoost) | ✅ | Uses recursive hourly predictions |
| Preprocessing via `features.py` | ✅ | Extracts lag, time, and technical indicators |
| Handles input validation | ✅ | Returns appropriate HTTP errors for invalid input |
| Swagger UI schema integration | ✅ | Fully documented with schema, example input/output |
| JSON response structure | ✅ | Follows format:<br>`{ "ticker": "TSLA", "predictions": [ { "datetime": "...", "price": ... }, ... ] }` |

---

### 🧪 Acceptance Criteria

| Scenario | Test Method | Result |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| ✅ Valid ticker + model | Swagger: `{ "ticker": "AAPL", "horizon_hours": 24 }` | Returns list of predictions |
| ✅ Invalid ticker | `{ "ticker": "XYZ123" }` | Returns fallback or clean error |
| ✅ Schema validation | POST with no body / wrong format | Returns 422 error |
| ✅ JSON structure | Reviewed response | `ticker + hourly predictions[]` |

### 🛠 Tools Used
- **FastAPI** – API framework
- **yfinance** – Real-time market data
- **pandas** – Data wrangling
- **xgboost** – ML model inference
- **Docker + Azure VM** – Deployment and testing

### 📈 Future Model Plan

As part of Phase 2+ of the project, the following enhancements are planned:

#### 🔹 Model Expansion
- Add support for multiple models: `lstm`, `lightgbm`, `ensemble` (`/predict-ensemble`)
- Allow user-specified model input or automatic selection

#### 🔹 Model Accuracy Improvements
- Train with historical + real-time enriched features
- Integrate:
  - Technical indicators (already implemented)
  - Sentiment features (Twitter/news)
  - Macroeconomic indicators (interest rates, CPI, etc.)
  - Company fundamentals

#### 🔹 Training Infrastructure
- Create a `/train` and `/retrain` endpoint
- Store models in persistent volume or S3
- Auto-train for each ticker on schedule or on-demand

#### 🔹 Trading-Readiness Enhancements
- Return confidence intervals
- Align prediction timestamps strictly with NYSE/NASDAQ hours
- Log latency, prediction scores, and anomalies

### 📦 Next Recommended Tickets
- #8: `/predict-ensemble` using weighted voting
- #9: `/top-movers` daily % change
- #10: Backtest utility for model evaluation

---

### ✅ Summary
This ticket is fully complete. The `/predict` endpoint is operational, deployed, tested via Swagger, and accurately returning forecast output based on real-time data and preprocessing logic. We're now ready to evolve toward multi-model ensemble support and training pipelines.
