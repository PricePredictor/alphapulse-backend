# ✅ Ticket #5: Add Modular Model Pipelines (XGBoost, LSTM, Linear)

## 📅 Completed On: 2025-06-04

---

## 📝 Description

Implement modular model loading and prediction functions for XGBoost, LSTM, and Linear Regression. Each model exposes a unified `predict(ticker, data)` interface and includes error handling with fallback to dummy predictions.

## 📦 Deliverables

- [x] `app/models/xgboost_model.py`
- [x] `app/models/lstm_model.py`
- [x] `app/models/linear_model.py`
- [x] `scripts/test_models.py` (Validation script for all models)

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

| Test Scenario         | Status | Details |
|----------------------|--------|---------|
| Model Load           | ✅     | All models load without import errors |
| XGBoost Prediction   | ✅     | Prediction returns a float value |
| LSTM Prediction      | ✅     | Shape issue resolved and valid output returned |
| Linear Model         | ✅     | Dummy linear trend model returns expected value |
| Invalid Input Fallback | ✅   | Errors gracefully handled with `np.nan` fallback |

## 🧾 Commit History

- `Ticket #5: Add modular model loaders and test script`
- `Ticket #5: Finalize model test coverage and fix LSTM shape issue`

---

## 📌 Notes

- LSTM shape error fixed by matching expected `(None, 10, 4)` input shape.
- All models now use consistent fallback in case of error.
- Test script logs each step explicitly for clarity.
